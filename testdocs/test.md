### Narrative Workgroup

 - Name and date of meeting: Narrative Workgroup, 2023-09-21
 - People present: Felix [host], Tevo [documenter], Peter
 - Media: https://miro.com/board123

Meeting narrative: 
 - [Issues]
1. Onboarding email gives mistaken impression that recipients have definitely been accepted as ambassadors. Needs correcting.
2. Some meetings have not been very welcoming to new people.
3. Name of "ambassadors only" meeting might be unclear, especially since new people have received an email that may have given them the impression that they are already ambassadors.
4. There is discussion in other workgroups about hierarchies, levels, names etc for different levels of involvement: but since these are not agreed yet, we'll send out the onboarding email to the backlog of people (c. 300) describing the process as it currently stands.
5. Suggestion to implement the idea from a few meetings ago of asking people to attend as many meetings as they can, just once, and send feedback. This is includd in draft onboarding email: to be discussed further outside meeting.

Action items: 
 - [action] Fix onboaarding email [assignee] Felix [due] 2023-09-27
 - [action] Send out new emails [assignee] Teov [due] 2023-09-27
